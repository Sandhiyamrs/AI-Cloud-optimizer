# 📘 CASE STUDY — AI-Cloud-Optimizer (AI-Powered Cloud Cost & Usage Management)

---

## 🧩 1. Overview
**AI-Cloud-Optimizer** is an intelligent cloud resource analysis system that monitors cloud usage patterns, detects cost inefficiencies, and provides AI-powered optimization recommendations.  
The system predicts future usage, identifies idle or underutilized resources, and suggests optimal scaling strategies to reduce cloud spending.

This project demonstrates how **AI + Cloud Monitoring** can significantly improve operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 2. Problem Statement
Organizations often overspend on cloud resources due to:
- Unused or idle virtual machines  
- Over-provisioned storage  
- Incorrect instance types  
- Lack of predictive analytics  
- No automated cost alerts  

Cloud providers offer metrics, but not intelligent insight.  
AI-Cloud-Optimizer solves this by delivering **intelligent, automated optimization insights**.

---

## 💡 3. Objectives
- Analyze real-time cloud consumption metrics  
- Predict future usage and cost spikes  
- Identify idle or underutilized resources  
- Recommend auto-scaling strategies  
- Provide a centralized analytics dashboard  
- Reduce operational cost with AI-driven decisions
